// This file is the header for the @EventActionBase@ class.

// A base class for Geant user event actions

// When you create an event action object, you have the option to overload the
// following methods:

// @BeginOfEventAction@ - This method, which takes a pointer to a constant
// @G4Event@ object, is called once at the beginning of each event. Note that
// this occurs after the primaries have been constructed and passed to the 
// event manager, but before anything is simulated. Putting code in this 
// method of an action object is equivalent to putting it in the 
// @BeginOfEventAction@ method of the simulation's event action class.

// @EndOfEventAction@ - This method, which takes a pointer to a constant
// @G4Event@ object, is called once at the end of each event. This is the 
// last time the event object is accessible (right before the state changes
// from EventProc (in which the event is accessible) to GeomClosed). Putting
// code in this method of an action object is equivalent to putting it in the
// @EndOfEventAction@ method of the simulation's event action class.
