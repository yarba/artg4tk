// ArtG4TrackingAction.hh provides declarations for the built-in tracking action
// for the Art G4 simulation. In its two main methods, PreUserTrackingAction
// and PostUserTrackingAction, it gets the collection of all action objects
// registered for the simulation job and loops over them, calling their
// respective methods (conveniently called Pre/PostUserTrackingAction).
